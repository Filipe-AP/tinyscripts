# Tinyscripts

Hi there! I'm Filipe Albero Pomar and somehow you managed to find my GitHub repo. 

In here you'll find tiny scripts I create to automate some repetitive tasks.

The code snippets here are messy, half-formed and unpolished.

But they might actually be useful to other people. 

Let me know if I can help.
